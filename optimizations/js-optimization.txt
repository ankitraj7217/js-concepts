1. defer vs async

2. <script type="module"> -> is same as defer
    <script type="async"> -> useless

3. web worker -> so that main thread is not blocked
    Avoid DOM manipulation here -> as communication takes time and user wants it instantly

4. use setTimeout stuff to do some work and then come back
